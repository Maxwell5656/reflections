When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If I was collaborating with a group of people so they could easily access my code, or I wanted to save a project to the cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Often, implementing a new feature can take multiple commits, and you might not want anyone else to see you're incomplete code straight away.
