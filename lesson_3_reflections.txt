When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If I was collaborating with a group of people so they could easily access my code, or I wanted to save a project to the cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Often, implementing a new feature can take multiple commits, and you might not want anyone else to see you're incomplete code straight away.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A branch is a copy of commits that are still in the same repository as their parent. A clone is a copy of a repository on Github copied to a local machine. A fork is a copy of a repository on Github copied to another repository on Github. A fork should be use to copy a Github repository to your account, a clone should be used to get a Github repository to a local machine, and a branch should be used for making experimental changes in one repository.
