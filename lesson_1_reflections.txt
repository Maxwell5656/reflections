How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It helped me by showing me all the differences in the different files 
quickly and easily. Had I not used a command like that, It could have 
taken me hours to find that one typo.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

If you make an error, you can go back to an older version and compare
the two, making it easier to see what you did wrong.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

When you choose when to save, like in Git, the commits can better 
follow a logical system of saving. On the other hand, manually saved 
commits are affected by user error, so you might forget when to save.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is designed with coding in mind,  so it needs to keep track of
different files for html, css, javascript, and so on. Google Docs
is not designed this way.

How can you use the commmands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

I can use git log to see all the commits, and I can use git diff
to see differences between them.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

If I break something, I can always go back to a prievious commit and 
see what I did wrong.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Mostly helping me code.
