What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, Git creates the nessesary file in 
order to keep track of commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to better choose what updates you want to
commit.
